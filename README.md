# Order-Book
A OOP C# exercise from a couple years ago when I first had a look at OOP principles. This is an Order Book back end structure which implements a few classes for each order entry. This also includes a few tests for data integrity.

Would love to revisit this some day ahead and give it actual functionality and a GUI.
